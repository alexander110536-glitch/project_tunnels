You go to the sound of the voice and see a old man with wrinkly skin. He slaps you across the face and says "you boys have no respect now a days. Why are you boys even down here in these tunnels". One of your friends gets scared and runs away. You than ask the old man why he slap you and apologize for grabing is katana. He then says "I don't  like  apologize's you boys shouldn't even be down here"

"If you want me to forgive you would have to beat me on a 1v1 then I would forgive you" he said. Your friend then says " this is stupid, just forget about it and let's go. Don't tell me you forgot why we came here in the first place" The old man then says" If you beat me I might help you find what you are looking for" Do you want to fight the crazy old man or forget about him and find your friend that ran off and continue on your search.
