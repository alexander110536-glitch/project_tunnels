You continue on the tunnel you are already on and you something shiny in the distance you go to see what it is. As you get closer your one of your friends runs ahead and picks it up. He then cuts him self accidentally you all look at the object in shock. Your friend says "do you think it could be his?".

You get a good look at the katana that still has some of your friends blood on it. You look at your friends hand covered in blood and ask him if he is okay. He says yeah but you can see him holding back his pain.Do you want to treat his wounds or keep going since he said he was okay.(treat wound/keep going)
