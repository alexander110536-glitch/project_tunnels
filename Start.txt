You and your three friends are exploring underground abandoned tunnels on a Saturday afternoon.
They wanted to see if the rumor was true about a mutant rat(Takeru) who was a master of Aikido,
and Wing Chun(aura farming). The rumor says that he was a normal human until one fateful night a rival master(Isamu)
in the same martial arts.Isamu killed Takeruâ€™s family and when takeru found out he wanted to do one last battle
to the death with Isamu but not in any regular place but in an old underground tunnel that was a bridge connecting
to other tunnels but underneath the bridge was toxic was. So the first one to fall off the bridge would die
and lose their life in battle. This battle was known as the last ultimate battle of the bridge also known
as the battle of 1988. But Isamu tricked Takeru and brought an army of his disciples, and Takeru was surrounded.
He fought back bravely but was overloaded by the enemy and so he lost the battle and fell into the toxic waste.
Takeru was thought to be dead until so kids went into the tunnels in the late 90s and said they saw some type
of human rat mutant that was guarding the entrance to the bridge so the rumor started worse than ever that
Takeru was waiting for Isamu to battle him for real and win.

You and your friends come across the  tunnel where the battle of 88 was fought. The tunnel was split into two.
 Your friend forgot the map at his house since you're the oldest they ask you which tunnel to go through right,
  or left? (don't forget the tunnels are unstable you have to choose left/right)
