You decide to follow the shadow thinking you would see Takaru.The figeure suddenly stop and so did you guys .You then hear a deep voice come from the shadowy figure that sends a chill down your spine. It said "You boys shouldn't be down here ".You responed "We are looking around to see if Takaru is actully alive, would you happen to see him". 

He then responded back to you "I am actully also seeing if the rumor is true so I can truely finish Takaru's bloodline once in for all". You then realise thar the person you were talking to was Isamu. He then said "you boy's should leave here, there is a exit here on the left".  So you guys start walking to the exit.but one of your friends say 
" we came all this way just to leave because an old man tells us to". Do you want to listen to your friend and follow Isamu secretly or do you want to leave while you still can.
